  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I was pretty confident when using repl.it, but not so much in GitHub.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To produce a program in Python that asks the user to enter their first name and surname. I will need to report back to the user information about the relative lengths of their names.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, and the program I came up with worked and was slick. </td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I had a think myself, trying to work out how to make the program worked effectively and when I got really stuck, I asked the person sitting next to me, and that worked well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning as I was able to ask for help when necessary, and the teacher pointed me in the right direction, which was very helpful.
</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, I will develop my GitHub and repl.it program even further, expanding my knowledge of the websites in the progress.</td>
