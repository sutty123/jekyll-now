    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To successfully create the basic layout of my website so my Google Doc is able to publish.</td>

(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, as I was able to get my Google Doc to publish.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration. I followed the demonstration step-by-step and I was able to complete the task.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when I tried to add a background picture, so I will need some help with that next lesson.

This made me change my ways and I decided to do some research on Google. This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.</td>

    <td>Try to search things up before I ask for help from the teacher. Also, I can try and work better independently when things go a bit wrong...</td>
