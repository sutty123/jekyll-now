  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>At the start of the year, I had no idea what github was, how to use it, and the what you could get out of it. When it came to repl.it, I had no clue was it was as I had never heard of it before this year.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this year?</td>
    <td>I wanted to have a successful blog site which I could post regular blogs on and have a successfully running repl.it game that someone could play and enjoy. Throughout the year, I wanted to add to my repl.it program using the information I will have taken on board from the inspiration of BuzzFeed Quizzes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, and both my repl.it game and my github were a success.</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Over the course of Year 9, I had many learning strategies including the likes of perseverance. There were times when I thought I should give in and stop working, but I pushed through and got out what I put into the projects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing really limited my learning apart from the fact that the Wi-Fi was down at times!
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next year? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next year, I will keep persevering and throwing myself at whatever faces me in Year 10.</td>
